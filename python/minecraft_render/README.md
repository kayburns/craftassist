# Use Minecraft Render

We use [Chunky](https://github.com/chunky-dev/chunky) to render everything in minecraft world.

For License issue, we can not include Chunky code in our repo. Please download ChunkyLauncher [here](https://github.com/chunky-dev/chunky) and put it under python/minecraft_render in order to use minecraft renderer.
