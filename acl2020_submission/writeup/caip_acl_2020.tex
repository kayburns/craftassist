\begin{abstract}
We propose a semantic parsing dataset focused on instruction-driven communication with an agent in the game Minecraft\footnote{Minecraft features: \textcopyright Mojang Synergies AB included courtesy of Mojang AB}.  
%The dataset consists of 32K human generated instructions with their parses, derived from a large collection of templates.   
The dataset consists of 
%several thousand templates that can synthesize surface forms and their parses, and
 ~7K human utterances and their corresponding parses.  Given proper world state, the parses can be interpreted and executed in game. 
We report the performance of baseline models, and analyze their successes and failures.
% and find that while we are able to train a usable interface with the agent, there is 
 % dataset reveals interesting generalization challenges.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have described a grammar over a mid-level interface for a Minecraft assistant. We then discussed the creation of a dataset of natural language utterances with associated logical forms over this grammar that can be executed in-game. Finally, we showed the results of using this new dataset to train several neural models for parsing natural language instructions.  %We find that the models we trained were able to fit the templated data nearly perfectly, but were less accurate on human-generated data.  v
Consistent with recent works, we find that BERT pre-trained models do better than models trained from scratch, but there is much space for improvement.
We believe this data will be useful to researchers studying semantic parsing, especially interactive semantic parsing, human-robot interaction, and even imitation and reinforcement learning. The code, dataset and annotation tools described in the paper have been open-sourced \footnote{\url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/craftassist/tree/master/acl2020_submission}}. 



% The problem of using a small amount of parsed human data with the infinite generations of our grammar to improve results on human-distribution; or otherwise building models that can generalize to the human distributions is an exciting area for future work.   
%More generally, we hope that the grammar, templates, and human data will be useful to researchers studying human-robot and human assistant interaction.  


%and hope that future work tackling the task presented here may produce better results.
