        <p>Please help us determine the exact meaning of the command shown to you.
        The command is given to an AI assistant to help out a player in the game of Minecraft.</p>

        <p>You will answer a series of questions. Each question is either multiple-choice,
         or requires you to select which words in the sentence correspond to which components of the command.</p>
        <p>
        <b>1. Place your mouse arrow over the questions and options for detailed tips.</b></br>
        <b>2. When selecting the words, please select all words (along with properties of the thing).</b> So in "destroy the blue house" select "blue house" and not just "house"</br>
        <b>3. Please also note that: </b>some questions are optional, click on "Click if specified" if you think those are mentioned in the command.
        </p>

        <p>Few examples below:</p>
        <p><b>"come"</b>
        <ul>
        <li>For "What action is being requested?", the answer is "Move or walk somewhere"</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><b>"make two small cubes here"</b>
        <ul>
        <li>"What action is being requested?" -> "Build, make a copy or complete something"</li>
        <li>"Is this an exact copy or duplicate of an existing object?" -> "No". The assistant is asked to "Build a fresh complete, specific object"</li>
        <li>For "Select words specifying what needs to be built" select the words: 'small cubes'</li>
        <li>For "Select words specifying where the construction needs to happen", click on the word: 'here'</li>
        <li>For "How many times should this action be performed?", select "Repeatedly, a specific number of times"
        and then "two" for 'How many times'</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>"dig until you reach water"</b>
        <ul>
        <li>"What action is being requested?" -> "Dig"</li>
        <li>For "How many times should this action be performed?" -> 'Repeated until a certain condition is met'</li>
        <li>For "Until the assistant reaches some object(s) /area" select: "water"</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Note that: repeats may be disguised, for example: 'follow the pig' should be interpreted as "repeat forever: move to the location of the pig".</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>"go to the large pole near the bridge"</b></br>
        <ul>
        <li>"What action is being requested?" -> "Move or walk somewhere"</li>
        <li>"Select words specifying the location to which the agent should move" -> "the large pole near the bridge". </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>"construct a 4 x 4 house"</b></br>
        <ul>
        <li>"What action is being requested?" -> "Build, make a copy or complete something"</li>
        <li>"Is this an exact copy or duplicate of an existing object?" -> "No". The assistant is asked to "Build a fresh complete, specific object"</li>
        <li>For "Select words specifying what needs to be built" select the words: '4 x 4 house'</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Note that: For build and dig actions, the words for size of the thing should be selected as a part of what needs to be built / dug. For example: in "construct a 4 x 4 house", select "4 x 4 house" as the thing to be built.</b>
